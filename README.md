# Uberver

So, the first thing to track is what projects I want to do, and any notes that I have for them.
I want to set up some "Home server" type of things.
Eventually put on a real server of my own and get things to work really well.
Linux is good, and the "headless" server approach seems best. 
I have my System76 Bonobo so I sholud be good to use that and set up a server with something from System76 like the 
Thelio with Birch, but I should try and test things on my laptop first.
What I need to find:
three things to put into the laptop and test.
1. a cloud-based note-taking app or site or something.
2. Jellyfin or something similar as a cloud to host things on.
3 a music server
These are all thing I can do a QA build in the VM, but will be IP based and need to be a real machine not a VM.
The note app should be the best to go with.
This is end of day Friday, as long as the work week isn't nuts, I should be able to do some researh and see what I find.
hopeflly there are updates to come.
-Q-
This is a test to see if the password is saved.
Second test for password saving, pretty sure I needed to enable credential helper?
That might have done it, now seeing if it worked
-Q-
That did not seem to do it, cleared the file, re-ran.
Testing now.
-Q-
Ensuring it worked.
-Q-
Nope, that didn't work,
not focusing on it.
I can keep the password in my head.
